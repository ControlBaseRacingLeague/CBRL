### Article 1.3 - Attendance in League Races
1. By registering for a full seat in the league races, you commit to be available during all races in the season for the duration
of the competition season. If you are unable to attend, mark the attendance as unable to attend on the check in bot. We can fill your seat with a reserve driver for the week.
2. By registering for a reserve seat in the league races, you can without obligation sign up for an empty seat. Once registered, you commit to attending. Vacancies will be posted in the reserve driver channel about 24 hours before the race start. 
3. Points earned will be credited to the reserve driver.
4. If a driver is inexplicably absent, the driver may lose his seat. A reserve driver can then prioritize a claim to a vacant seat.
5. If you can't make it to the races anymore, you don't need a reason to leave the competition. Please let us know so we can fill the seat.
6. Drivers are expected be in the lobby 5 minutes before the designated start time. If drivers are still not present with 5 minutes until the session start time, their seat will be offered to the first available reserve driver eligible for it. 


### Article 1.4 - Race Session Time
1. Race sessions are time-boxed to 1 hour and 20 mins total for 35% races.
2. Race sessions are time-boxed to 2 hours total for 50% races.
3. The session timer starts from the designated start time 
4. If a race is still going when the timer ticks to 0, there will be one extra lap and that will be considered the final lap of racing. 
5. After a final lap, as referred to in article 1.4 under 4, a virtual chequered flag will be thrown. Once the race is over the divison will be pinged and we will go off the results from the final lap.

## Section 2. Clean Driving
In this section the rules for clean driving will be mentioned.

### Article 2.1 Official Fia rules
1. Basically, the official rules of the FIA apply as clean driving.
2. Rules in the Code of Conduct are often intended to provide game-specific elements.
3. All Rules mentioned in CBRL's Code of Conduct supersede the FIA rules or are intended to supplement or clarify.



### Article 2.2 Incident Report
1. If a driver is consequently causing too many incidents, the admins have the right to remove their seat
2. If an incident occurs that you think is unfair or controversial, you can official report it to get a steward's opinion. A report is bound by the following requirements;
   a) A report for a 'League Race' must be submitted with evidence and reasoning why you believe this is an incident
   b) Stewards may expect images to be supplied in sufficient quality. All images/recordings should be as close to source quality as possible.
   c) Incidents must be submitted within 48 hours of their occurrence.
   d) If the requirements are met, stewards will review and handle the report.

### Article 2.4 Defend incident
1.  If there has been an accident that you think someone is claiming was your fault, but you don't think it is, you should record your side in defense too. The more corners the stewards have, the higher the chance for a correct outcome
2. If images are requested by the stewards from a driver, the driver is obliged to provide them. An exception applies if these images are not available.
3. If requested images cannot be provided, the driver will be asked to share their PoV.
4. A driver must meet the question posed in this article within 48 hours.

### Article 2.5 Return to track
1. Reset to track is in all cases prohibited and will result in 25 second time penalty.
2. If you leave the track (all 4 wheels off track) or spin on track, it is your responsibility for a safe return to racing. If facing the opposite direction wait, apply the brakes to stop the car rolling, and look for a gap in traffic to spin the car around. If in a dangerous position on track, try to move to a safer position at the earliest opportunity that is safe for other drivers.
3. If returning to the track, also wait for a gap in the traffic or an opportunity to join the track from the racing line at a sensible speed.
4. If you are a driver on track coming across a driver attempting to rejoin at a comparable speed, try to
give them space for the rejoin if it is safe to do so. 
5. All return to track incidents will be considered as if ghosting is not in action, even if it is. Punishments will be given out to incidents that are considered irresponsible returns to racing, especially ones that impact other drivers.

### Article 2.6 AI driving
1. Using AI off the grid is prohibited and will result in 5 second time penalty.
2. If you need to retire from the race, please retire in the pitlane.
3. You are still liable for incidents your AI causes and stewards will judge them as if you are in control.

## Section 3. Rules of Engagement

### Article 3.1 Significant car length alongside
1. As a guide should be considered when the front wheels of the attacker are level with the cockpit of the defending car at corner entry. The further forward is of course more concrete and clearer.
2. Back wheel (defender) to front wheel (attacker) is not a significant car length alongside.
3. This rule will be considered/measured on a case-by-case basis by stewards when incidents occur.
4. As soon as you see the red arrow incidcator on your screen you must give the other car space, turning in on them or forcing them wide will result in a penalty of 10 seconds.
5. Closing the door when there is a red indicator is likely to cause incident, which will most likely affect your race and has the potential to stain your track record and character.
6. When making a move, you must do so in a safe manner. If the car ahead has to avoid you sending it up the inside by adjusting their steering by turning away from the apex, you will recieve a 5 second penalty for this.


### Article 3.2 Defending track positions
1. When defending positions, it is important for drivers to make their moves proactively, meaning they are placing their cars where they think is the best position to defend.
2. A proactive move is any move made by the defender before the attacker has chosen or displayed a direction of attack for an overtake.
3. A Reactive move involves changing direction/position once an attacker has made their intentions clear and are not allowed.

### Article 3.3 Defending weaving and re-opening
1. When defending, drivers are allowed to make 1 single change of direction to defend their position and an additional move to re-open up the corner before the breaking zone if the line is clear. Any additional moves will be judged as weaving.
2. When re-opening up the corner they must always leave space for the attacker if any part of their car is alongside you, indicated by a red arrow. This takes precedent over rule 3.1.

### Article 3.4 Defenders space at corner
1. Defenders should aim to leave space for attacking cars at every corner but it is only absolutely required when cars are a significant car length beside you at corner entry.
2. Corner entry is the point at which the driver starts to move their car towards the corner apex


### Article 3.5 Defenders responsibility
1. If a defender makes a mistake during a corner, for instance going deep on brakes or a twitch on acceleration, it is the responsibility of the attacker to adjust their racing line/speed to avoid incident unless the defending car leaves the track as part of their mistake.

### Article 3.6 Defender with slow pace
1. If the defending car in front has slower pace than the attacker, this does not give the attacker the right to presume the car in front should get out of the way. They have earned their position in front of you through strong racing, strategy or consistency. Show them the respect they deserve.

### Article 3.7 Attackers responsibility
1. At corner entry (the point at which the driver starts to move their car towards the corner apex), the attacker should have a significant part of their car alongside the defender (defined in rule 3.1).
2. If the attacker doesn't have a significant part of their car ahead then any further attempts to take the place during the corner resulting in contact will be deemed the attackers fault.
3. The defending driver only is required to leave space if a significant part of the car is alongside. If there is a red arrow then they are required to give as much space so that the other car has 2 wheels within the white line
4. The attacker should always keep in mind the risks they are taking when participating in an overtaking maneuver vs the reward of pulling it off. Sometimes it is better to wait for a more clearcut overtaking opportunity later in the lap at an easier place to overtake then go for a risky overtake through a technical sector.

### Article 3.8 Giving back a place
1. If you are informed that you need to give a place back due to an on-screen warning, you have to do this in a safe and predictable way.
2. We urge drivers doing so to wait until an open and straight part of the track to peel off the racing line and lift off the throttle (not brake) ensuring there is no car behind. After giving the place up the driver can rejoin the racing line when it‚Äôs safe to do so.
3. You may end up having to let multiple cars through to give up the specific position requested.
4. If you feel that you have gained an unfair advantage via an illegal overtake, for example (but not limited to) you ran wide during or after an overtake or gained a position unfairly under yellow flags/safety cars, you may decide to give the place back without the prompt of the on-screen display. You are still required to follow all the guidelines under 3.8.
5. If a car gives a position back on track, this can lessen or nullify a penalty investigation.
6. There are occasions where you may feel a cede position warning is either too dangerous to complete or unwarranted. It may also be the case that the car behind is not willing to overtake. In this case it may be better to take the penalty and serve it at the pit-stops or at the end of the race. If you feel the penalty is unwarranted you can get this reviewed with stewards as a racing incident as under 2.3.
7. Although the on-screen prompt may disappear, you have to give the place fully back (car is no longer side by side) and not attack the car until past the braking zone into another corner.
8. If giving a place back to another driver, it is your responsibility to avoid collisions with other drivers and to do so in a safe manor.
9. If you spin another driver or cause a collsion with them, you are required to give the position back.

## Section 4. Safety Car Procedure

### Article 4.1 Remain in line
1. Drivers must remain in line during virtual and standard safety car periods. 
2. This is to allow other cars the ability to warm up their tires without the fear that a car will be suddenly in its space. This is the case throughout the entirety of the safety car period, including when preparing to resume the race.
3. Cars can resume going side by side once you have passed the first green flag/light on track and the OSD no longer states ‚Äúcaution‚Äù after a safety car restart. If cars go side by side, the source of the infringement will be investigated and acted upon

### Article 4.2 Correct speed
1. Drivers must remain predictable and at the correct speed for the safety car/section of track they are in. Braking sharply or backing other drivers up so your team mate can pit, amongst other reasons, are not allowed and will result in action from the stewards.

### Article 4.3 Follow OSD Display
1. Drivers must follow the OSD display
2. Drivers may ignore the OSD if is is obviously incorrect. The driver than needs to make a recording and let it review after the race by a stewards as a racing incident as under 2.3.
3. Drive-through penalties accrued for not following the delta must be served and cannot be reviewed by the stewards.

### Article 4.4 Overtake under Safety Car
1. Drivers can overtake cars going unduly slowly. This is applied only if the car has spun on the track or have left the defined track area (all 4 wheels over the white lines).
2. This also applies to cars that have caught up with the pack and have fallen more than 10 car lengths behind.
3. Drivers cannot unlap themselves, the game doesn't allow it. If you are a lap down, then you are probably out of contention for the race win so just focus on your race from there.
4. Drivers can overtake cars entering the pits once they have crossed the white line signaling pit entry. Drivers can also overtake cars leaving the pits until the end of the white line. Once the car leaving the pit has crossed beyond the end of the white line, drivers must stay behind if they don't have any of their car in front.
5. If you have damage you must let other cars past, you must leave the track with 4 wheels to do so. Going unduly slowly on the racing track on purpose will draw a dim view from the stewards and could result in a penalty. If you have damage, it is accepted that you will be slower and other drivers must accommodate for that.
6. If you have accidentally took a place by mistake that was unjust/incorrect without receiving an on-screen warning to give the place back, the stewards are offering the opportunity for cars to give the places back after the safety car restart. This should only be done after green flag racing has resumed, to avoid penalty warnings for other drivers, and should be completed if possible before the end of the first sector.
7. If you are found to have overtaken under safety car without good reason and not given the place back or only given the place back under duress, you will be penalized if a race-incident had been reported or seen by stewards.

### Article 4.5 Restart from Safety Car
1. As lead driver, it is your responsibility to resume racing in a safe manor for the whole field.
2. The restart should consist of one clear return to racing.
3. Any ambiguity around speeding up and slowing down will be penalized.
4. Drivers should wait for the safety car to be at pit-entry/'prepare to resume racing' message to show before any acceleration to resume racing, to avoid being slowed down by the game. If the game does slow you down, you are still accountable for your actions for not correctly following the game‚Äôs instructions.
5. A constant speed is mandatory so that the field can react. Once accelerated, it is mandatory to maintain this speed at least. At a corner you may slow down at the braking point as far as necessary, after which you build up the old speed as quickly as possible.

## Section 5. Blue Flag Procedure

### Article 5.1 Blue flag shown
1. If drivers that are more than a lap up on you are approaching you from behind, the game will show a blue flag UI message and flag light panels will start to flash blue on track.
2. Once you receive the message/see the lights you will be counted as a 'blue flagged car' and you in total 6 blue flag lights to show that you are letting the lapping driver through.
3. Blue flagged cars are advised to get out of the way at the next available opportunity, preferably on a straight and always off the racing line following the rules in article 3.8.
4. Blue flagged cars do not have to jump out of the way as soon as they see the messages but instead when it best suits both cars, within the 6 flag limit.
5. Blue flagged cars are advised to cede positions to all other cars that are approaching you from behind that are a lap up, but this isn't a requirement. As soon as you let one car by the 6 light warning resets, and you have another 6 lights to let the next lapping car through.
6. When ceding positions as a blue flagged car it is important to be clear and predictable to other drivers. It is not required that you leave the track to let lapped runners through but if you do leave the track, you must rejoin it in a safe way so others are not impeded by your rejoin, as per normal racing conditions.
7. Some digression will be given to the 6 flag warning limit depending on the track configuration and space available. This digression will only be given if it is clear to stewards that the blue flagged car is trying everything in its power to let the lapping car through at the earliest point possible.

### Article 5.2 Coming up to blue flagged traffic
1. As a car coming up to blue flagged traffic, it is important to remember that the cars ahead don't have to jump out of the way as soon as they see your car. They are running their own race.
2. During some sectors/circuits it is difficult to find space to come off the racing line and slow, so think about when you first got the message/how long it takes them to get out of your way before reporting it to the stewards.
3. As a car approaching blue flag traffic, be mindful that they will try to peel off of the racing line and slow down, so leave them a bit of breathing room for them to do their thing. Forcing an overtake that is unsafe on a blue flagged car will be deemed as an incident like any other under the rules of engagement section.

### Article 5.3 Un-lapping
1. Tt is advised against un-lapping yourself unless you have a significant pace advantage. Remember, during attempts to un-lap yourself, normal section rules apply as if you were an Attacking driver and moves should be cleaner than clean. Your race ultimately isn't with them.

## Section 6. Restarting Lobbies

1. Guidance for restarting sessions: 
   a) If the session is red flagged during qualifying, the lobby will be reformed and qualifying length will be set to one shot.
   b) If the ready-up rule is the cause of the red flag then race director will inform drivers of the procedure for restart.The rules in section 7 can be followed to reform the grid, using screenshots of qualifying.
   c) If the red flag is flown during the race then depending on the time of the red flag the session could be:
      i) Restarted; If the race has less than 5 laps completed the race will restart for 100%, reforming the grid based off of qualifying results.
      ii) Restarted; If the race has been between 5 laps and half of race distance, reforming the grid based off of the order of the race from 2 laps before the red flag, or failing that information based off of race grid.
      iii) Abandoned with half points given; If the race has been between half of race distance and three-quarter race distance, half points will be awarded in positions of cars 2 laps before the red flag was issued.
      iv) Abandoned with full points given; If over three-quarter race distance has been completed, full points will be awarded in positions of cars 2 laps before the red flag was issued.
      
## Section 7. Readying up/Jump Start Rule

### Article 7.1 Ready
1. When sitting on the grid waiting for race start (the screen where you can change stints and tweak fuel load), only people with the @admin tag are allowed to ready up first.
2. If someone does ready up, either accidentally or on purpose, the lobby can be reseted. Grid will be reformed. The driver(s) who ready up will be pushed to the back of the grid without exception.
3. Readying up early not only wastes your time but the other drivers and staff that are involved in the race. You will be notified of a 2 minute break before joining the session. Failure to abide by this and not admitting to readying up early will result in a qualy ban for the next race.
4. If a driver breaks this rule more than once, they will be banned for the rest of the season.


## Section 9. Giving back a place

### Article 9.1 On-screen Warning
1. If you are informed you need to give a place back due to an on-screen warning, you have to do this in a safe and predictable way.
2. We urge drivers doing so to wait until an open and straight part of the track to peel off the racing line and lift off the throttle (not brake) ensuring there is no car behind.
3. If giving a place back to another driver, it is your responsibility to avoid collisions with other drivers and to do so in a safe manor
4. After giving the place up you can rejoin the racing line when it‚Äôs safe to do so. You may end up having to let multiple cars through to give up the specific position requested.

5. Although the on-screen prompt may disappear, you have to give the place fully back (car is no longer side by side) and not attack the car until past the braking zone into another corner.

### Article 9.2 Unfair Advantage and incidents
1. If you feel that you have gained an unfair advantage via an illegal overtake or after an incident, you may decide to give the place back without the prompt of the on-screen display. You are still required to follow the guidelines under article 9.1.
2. If a car gives a position back on track, this can lessen or nullify a penalty investigation.

### Article 9.3 Penalty after On-screen Warning
1. There are occasions where you may feel a cede position warning is either too dangerous to complete or unwarranted.
2. It may also be the case that the car behind is not willing to overtake.

3. In the case mentioned in 9.3 under 1 and 2, it may be better to take the penalty and serve it at the pit-stops or at the end of the race. If you feel the penalty is unwarranted you can get this reviewed with stewards.

## Section 10. Spirit of Competition

### Article 10.1 Retire procedure
1. If you need to retire from the race, please retire in the pitlane
2. When racing, you cannot retire from the race because the events of the race are not going your way. Retiring because things are not going your way is not respectful to other drivers putting their time into the session and will be served with a penalty, this will vary in the severity depending on a few factors:
 a) You are allowed to retire if you are a lap down
 b) You are allowed to retire if you have moderate to high damage (at least orange) to any part of the car that is not the front wing.

### Article 10.2 Hot Lap
1. If you are not on a hot lap during qualifying for the race it is your responsibility to clear the racing line for cars on a hot lap. 
2. If you are exiting the pit lane and trying to get out of the way of other drivers on a hot lap, be mindful that going too slowly will block the pit-lane and cause a DSQ for you and other drivers exiting the pit-lane behind you.
3. Blocking the pit-lane can be penalized if it affects other drivers and is within your control to not block it.
4. Causing a block on the first two runs of a short qualy session will result in a 5 second penaly.
5. Causing a block on the last run of qualyfying will result in a qualy ban for the next session. 

### Article 10.3 Track Limits
1. Crossing over track limits can result in a penalty and/or lap time removal from the stewarding team, even if the game says you were fine. 

### Article 10.4 Correct Tire
1. During qualifying, you must have the correct tires for the weather conditions, this applies to all sessions, even if you are leaving the pits to just set a lap time to get through to the next session.
2. You are allowed to use the inters on a dry track but you are not allowed to use the wets as it is unsafe to drive on them.
3. Do not use dry tires on a very wet track.
 
### Article 10.5 AI Takeover
1. If AI is taking control of your car for over half race distance your car will be removed from the race classification.
2. If your connection is unstable, please join back and retire your car from the race through the menu. Failure to not do so will result in you facing reprimands depending on the severity of the lag. If the lag is causing other drivers not to be able to race you, you will be removed from the race classification.
3. You are still liable for incidents your AI causes and stewards will judge them as if you are in control.


### Article 10.6 Low Fuel
1. The league uses a 'hard' fuel mode setting, meaning running out of fuel means you cruise along the track at low speed.
2. If in this mode, you should do everything within your power to remove yourself from the racing lines and moving off track to allow faster cars through. 
3. If you hit slow mode during qualifying, you must return to the pits. If you hit slow mode in the race, you are not allowed to cross the line more than once in slow mode. If you cross the line and are still racing (not reached race distance or race distance after being lapped) you need to retire your car from the session.

### Article 10.7 Teammates
1. Working with your teammate is a key area of league racing and in-race alliances will form as part of natural racing, but there shouldn‚Äôt be any pre-meditated attempts to disrupt the races.
2. You are not allowed to work alongside other drivers who are not your team mate in order to disrupt someone elses race.
3. If you are finding difficulties within the team you currently have, it is up to you to find another driver to swap with. Please notify an admin if you wish to do so.


## Section 11. In-game Penalty

### Article 11.1 Additional penalty
1. If the game doesn't give you a penalty but stewards find you to have infringed the rules, stewards have the power to take appropriate action. 


### Article 11.2 Unjust Penalty
1. If an automatic in-game penalty occurs which you feel is unjust, you may apply for a penalty removal request.
2. Incidents should be posted in the #league-incidents channel/thread with 3 pieces of evidence: 
   a) The incident itself. 
   b) A full recording of the incidents tab under race director (all incidents not just yours). 
   c) A full recording of the pit-stops tab under race director (all pit-stops not just yours).

3. Stewards can only remove penalties that are unserved at the end of the race. For instance;
   a) you get a 5 second warning for a collision but then pit and that time is removed, then the penalty is deemed to have been served. 
   b) you get a 5 second warning for a collision but you didn't pit, the 5 seconds added to your race time will be deemed as unserved.

4. We can only remove the time penalty that directly relates to your incident and cannot be transferred to other unserved penalties. 
5. An exception is article 9.3, this can still be reviews by stewards after it was served but that is not a promise it can be removed.

## Section 12. Point and License System

### Article 12.1 Race points
1. Championship points are awarded in the following order: 25, 18, 15, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 1 (+1 FL).
